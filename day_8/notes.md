## Learnings

This article was useful. It showed me new datatype
    - `Rc<T>` => provides shared ownership of a value of type T, allocated in the heap. (My last attempt got stack overflow error, so this was very much needed)
    - `RefCell<T>` => is a type that allows for interior mutability, which means that it allows you to mutate the contents of value even if you only have an immutable reference
