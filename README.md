  <i align="center">Solving Advent of Code challenges with Rust ü¶Ä</i>


</h3>

<br>

## Introduction

This is my repository for Advent of Code 2023. In this project, I am working on solving the daily coding challenges from Advent of Code using the Rust programming language. The goal was to learn Rust and become better at programming. For each challenge I have included my own notes, feel free to read them for my explanation. 

> While my solutions may not always be the fastest, I prioritize code readability. I firmly believe that readable code is better, although I strive to optimize for speed as well. Additionally, I'm currently learning Rust and facing time constraints due to exams, which occasionally impacts the best practices in my code. Consequently, I'm a bit behind on a few Advent of Code challenges.
