  <i align="center">Solving Advent of Code challenges with Rust ü¶Ä</i>


</h3>

<br>

## Introduction

This is my repository for Advent of Code 2023. Working on solving the daily coding challenges from Advent of Code using the Rust programming language. The goal was to learn Rust and become better at programming. For each challenge I have included my own notes, feel free to read them for my explanation. 

> While my solutions may not always be the fastest, I prioritize code readability. I believe that readable code is better, although I try to optimize for speed as well. Additionally, I'm currently learning Rust and facing time constraints due to exams. That is why I am a couple of days behind ;D
